A basic flask application to run automated deployment

# FLASK APP:
A Flask application is a Python script that imports the Flask module, creates an instance of the Flask class, and then start the development server using a line of code. To get started, you need to make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. Once Python and pip are installed, youâ€™re ready to install Flask. 
NOTE: It is usually recommended to create a Python virtual environment to isolate your flask application.
Once Flask is installed, you can start building your web application. To do this, create a new Python script and import the Flask module.

# REQUIREMENT FILE:
The requirements.txt file is the file that captures the current state of installed packages in your Python virtual environment. This file is often shared with others to replicate the environment or used for deployment purposes. It can be generated using the command 'pip freeze > requirements.txt'
